## Bit of my personal history

Started Splinterlands as many of us little bit later than I would love to :D
I pushed my account into Bronze and slowly tried to push to Silver. When I thought that I know it all I created extra account and few weeks later second one.

Now running 4 accounts and feel list splinterland manager. I felt I need to keep checking all the time multiple websites to get same info.
So I started developing in my spare timme this tool. 
Please let me know if you have some ideas / improvments and so on.
