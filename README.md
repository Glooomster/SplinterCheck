## Bit of my personal history

Started Splinterlands as many of us little bit later than I would love to :D
I pushed my account into Bronze and slowly tried to push to Silver. When I thought that I know it all I created extra account and few weeks later second one.

Now running 4 account splinterland manager is just too much time consuming so I started to created quick dashboard to quickly show info that I need.
